🧠 Beyond Research: What Keeps Me Inspired
Outside the lab, I love exploring the intersection of creativity and wellness. Whether it's experimenting with large language models in fun ways — like rewriting academic abstracts as poems — or designing polished visuals for my projects, I find joy in blending science with art. 
Staying active is also central to my life. I play volleyball regularly, enjoy long walks and biking, and stick to a strength training routine paired with protein-rich meals (plus the occasional tahdig hack 🍳). 
Music keeps me moving — especially trance and EDM — fueling both workouts and deep-focus sessions. 
I'm also an avid learner outside academia. I devour books and podcasts on longevity, metabolic health, and performance optimization — always curious about how we can feel and function better, longer.
