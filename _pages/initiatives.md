## Stanford Bio-X 2024 Interdisciplinary Seed Grant Recipient

I am the lead postdoctoral researcher and the main contributor on the awarded project:

**Enhancing Specialty Care with Digital Medical Consultations: A Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Approach**

This work was selected for funding through the [Stanford Bio-X Interdisciplinary Initiatives Program Seed Grant](https://biox.stanford.edu/research/seed-grants/interdisciplinary-initiatives-program-seed-grant-enhancing-specialty-care), which supports high-impact collaborative science.

- **Official PI**: Dr. Jonathan H. Chen  
- **Co-PIs**: Dr. Michael Bernstein, Dr. Robert Tibshirani, Dr. Mary Kane Goldstein  
- **Institution**: Stanford University  
- **My Role**: Lead Postdoctoral Researcher and Grant Lead 

This interdisciplinary project leverages RAG and LLMs to:
- Automate clinical consultations by suggesting guideline-aligned templates
- Improve access to specialty care
- Scale equitable, data-driven decision support across health systems

## Stanford HAI AI Index 2025 Contributor

I am contributing to the [2025 Stanford HAI AI Index Report](https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report).

I specifically contributed to **Chapter 5: Science and Medicine**, which explores the impact of AI on healthcare and biomedical research. My role focuses on:
- Highlighting major trends in non-imaging medical AI
- Surfacing data related to clinical NLP, decision support, and LLM evaluation
- Supporting global, accessible, policy-relevant insights for a broad audience

The AI Index Report is aimed at policymakers, researchers, and the public, and my role has included drafting content, identifying quantitative sources, and ensuring clarity in communication.

## Session Organizer — PSB 2025 & 2026

I co-organize the session **[AI and Machine Learning in Clinical Medicine](https://psb.stanford.edu/callfor/papers/ai.html)** at the [Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)](https://psb.stanford.edu/), a leading venue for interdisciplinary work at the intersection of biology, medicine, and computation.

This session focuses on the growing deployment of AI systems in clinical care and the increasing need for **interpretable, reliable, and fair** systems. Topics include:
- Explainability techniques for clinical ML/AI
- Evaluation of trustworthiness and factuality
- Real-world applications and policy implications of clinical LLMs
- Bias and fairness in healthcare AI systems

Our goal is to foster a rigorous scientific community that addresses the practical and ethical challenges of deploying AI in healthcare.

## Member — ARISE (Advancing Healthcare AI through Open Science)

I am a member of **ARISE**, an open research network dedicated to advancing the safety, reliability, and real-world evaluation of clinical AI systems through open science.

Through ARISE, I contribute to:
- Large-scale, realistic clinical benchmarks for AI evaluation (e.g., **NOHARM / MAST**)
- Open, reproducible methods for assessing clinical safety and reliability
- Community-driven research at the intersection of medicine, AI, and policy

ARISE brings together researchers across institutions to ensure that advances in medical AI translate into clinically meaningful and trustworthy systems.
