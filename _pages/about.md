I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford University, working with [Dr. Jonathan H. Chen](https://profiles.stanford.edu/jonc101) in the [HealthRex Lab](https://www.healthrexlab.com/). My research focuses on machine learning applications in healthcare, particularly in explainable AI, clinical decision support systems, and large language models (LLMs).

Much of my current work explores how LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can support clinical workflows, such as enhancing specialty consultations and answering patient messages. My research also focuses on LLM post-training and evaluation, ensuring AI-generated responses are accurate, reliable, and clinically useful. 
In addition to clinical NLP, I have contributed to projects on medical image segmentation using deconvolutional networks and developed novel approaches for quantization-free lossy image compression using integer matrix factorization, addressing both data efficiency and scalability in AI for healthcare.

Before Stanford, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium, in 2023. During my Ph.D., I worked in the [Data driven Healthcare](https://kulak.kuleuven.be/nl/onderzoek/Onderzoeksdomeinen/data-driven-healthcare/data-driven-healthcare) research group where I was supervised by [Prof. Celine Vens](https://www.kuleuven-kulak.be/~celine.vens/). My doctoral research focused on exploring semi-supervised learning approaches to improve time-to-event predictions by leveraging partially labeled clinical datasets.
