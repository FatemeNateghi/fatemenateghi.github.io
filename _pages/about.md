I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research, working with Dr. Jonathan H. Chen. My research focuses on machine learning applications in healthcare, particularly in explainable AI, survival analysis, and clinical decision support systems.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Sciences at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I developed predictive models for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. I also hold an MSc in Biomedical Engineering (Bioinformatics) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) and a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Guilan.

My work has been published in leading journals such as *Addiction*, *npj Digital Medicine*, *Scientific Reports*, and *IEEE Access*, and I have contributed to interdisciplinary projects involving electronic health records, AI policy reports, and clinical NLP.

Beyond research, I have served as a session organizer at PSB 2025 and am the lead postdoctoral researcher for the Stanford Bio-X 2024 Seed Grant project on enhancing specialty care using language models.
