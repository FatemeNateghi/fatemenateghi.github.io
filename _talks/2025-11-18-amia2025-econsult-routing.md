This invited talk presented our latest work on **SAGE (Specialist AI for Guiding Experts)** — an AI-driven system that automatically routes primary-care eConsult questions to the right specialty template using structured clinical knowledge and language models.

The talk covered:

- The referral crisis and inefficiencies in current eConsult workflows  
- Converting specialty templates into structured, machine-readable JSON  
- Embedding-based semantic retrieval  
- Four generations of model development (MPNet → BioClinicalBERT → GPT-routing → few-shot GPT reasoning)  
- Final performance:  
  - **83% Top-1 specialty accuracy**  
  - **99.7% Top-3 specialty accuracy**  
  - **78% Top-1 condition accuracy** (with filtering)  
- Deployment pathway for a clinically usable template-router
