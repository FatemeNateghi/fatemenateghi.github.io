Presented our work on **SAGE**, an AI-driven system for routing primary care eConsult questions to the right specialty and condition using structured templates, embeddings, and GPT-based reasoning.  
The talk highlights performance improvements across multiple approaches and demonstrates how SAGE can reduce workflow burden and improve specialty access.
